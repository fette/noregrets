Hearing damage is no joke. Good earplugs make life so much better for pretty much anyone who goes to loud places, like concert venues. [DUBS](https://www.amazon.com/Acoustic-Filters-Advanced-Earplugs-White/dp/B00NW1IZ5Q) are great earbuds: they're surprisingly comfortable, reusable, and don't distort sound.

They're basically a volume down button for the world.
