The [OXO Silicone Turner](https://www.oxo.com/products/cooking-baking/silicone-nylon-cooking-tools/silicone-flexible-turner) is the only spatula I've known to elicit feelings of joy and amazement, both from cooks and observers.

It feels (and is) sturdy, and is just the right balance of flexible and stiff. It's good on non-stick pans, doesn't melt, and can go in the dishwasher.
