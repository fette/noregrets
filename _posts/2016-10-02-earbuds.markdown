Do you like listening to music and also blocking out some sound from the outside world? Buy the [Philips SHE3590](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007TRUTZS/ref=pe_385040_30332200_pe_309540_26725410_item). They're cheap, they sound way better than they have any right to, and they're surprisingly comfortable.
